	This week I picked up a new game on Steam called <strong>It Lurks Below</strong>. The game is sort of a cross between Terraria and Diablo where you are in a 2D sidescrolling world where you can mine, craft and build things 
	but also there are classes and randomly generated magical weapons. The game is also currently in early access so there is a lot of missing content at the moment as well which means a lot more to come.

	The bulk of the game is basically like Terraria where you dig down, collect ores and build new armours to fight bosses and kill enemies. There is also a level system where you can level up by fighting 
	which allows you to increase your character stats and also a survial levelling system where you can unlock things like making your food last longer. Speaking of food, a big part of this game is farming your own 
	food and cooking as there is a hunger meter. If the hunger meter hits 0 then you will lose 10% of total HP a second until you die. You also have a fatigue meter which you can keeep in check by sleeping in a bed or 
	on the ground if you must.

	Picking a class in this game disapointed me a bit. It seems every class uses a wand no matter what, even if you play something like a Rogue. The only perks of picking a class from what I have seen is 
	when you hit a level in a multiple of 5, you unlock an upgradeable item. I played a Rogue and unlocked a stealth cape and a bunch of items that boost critcal strikes. No idea what the other classes get 
	as I havent ventured into them yet.

	All in all this game is still pretty fun to play even at this stage of early access but I am not sure it ventures far enough from Terraria at the moment to make me want to put in the kind of time that 
	I did on that game. I will be keeping an eye on how it develops and hwo knows, it might become its very own thing which is amazing.
